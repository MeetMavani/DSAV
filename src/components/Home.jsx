          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Data Structures are a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.
            They provide a means to manage large amounts of data for use in databases and internet indexing services.
            Examples of data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
            Each data structure has its own strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different types of tasks.

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems.
            They are the heart of computer science, enabling computers to perform tasks ranging from simple calculations to complex operations.
            Understanding algorithms is crucial because they define how data structures interact, and they help optimize performance.
            Examples include sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort and Quick Sort, searching algorithms like Binary Search, and graph algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
